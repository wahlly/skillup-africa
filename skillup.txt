Both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant have developed into excellent voice assistants.
They have dueling sets of features: Alexa supports multiple wake words, 
for instance, while Google lets you upload your own music to its cloud. 
Alexa is more configurable if you're willing to stick to its specific syntax,
while Google Assistant is easier to use, less frustrating, and more fluid.
Google's speakers generally sound better. But the 3.5mm output jack on Amazon's
models, as well as the Echo Input add-on, opens up a huge world of third-party 
speakers you can then Alexa-enable with little effort. Both assistants are 
also now available on a range of third-party speakers, including flagship
products from Bose and Sonos.

HOW AMAZON ECHO OR GOOGLE HOME CAN BE USED IN OUR HOME:
	Both Alexa and Google Assistant let you combine your devices into rooms,
so you can say things like "turn on the living room lights," 
and both support Routines, which let you combine multiple
 actions into one command.
Both the Echo and the Google Home link up to TVs using their associated
streaming sticks. If you buy a Chromecast or a Fire TV Stick, you can 
tell them to open Hulu or play a show. The Google Home has one big 
content advantage: It integrates with YouTube, which keeps appearing 
and disappearing from Echo devices because of a power struggle between
Google and Amazon.

THE INTERCONNECTION HAPPENING BETWEEN THESE DEVICES:
	the amazon echo and google home make use of the WI-FI network.
Therefore, we can conclude that the kind of interconnection happening
between these devices is a LOCAL AREA NETWORK.
